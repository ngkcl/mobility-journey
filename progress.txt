# Ralph Loop Progress

## Codebase Patterns (READ THIS FIRST!)
<!-- 
Consolidated learnings from all iterations.
Add REUSABLE patterns here, not story-specific details.
-->
- 

---

## Current Goal
<!-- High-level objective from PRD -->


## Metrics
- **Iteration:** 0 of MAX
- **Stories Complete:** 0 of TOTAL
- **Tests:** X passing, Y failing
- **Coverage:** Z%

---

## Last Completed
<!-- Most recent iteration's work -->
- [ ] Nothing yet — first iteration

## Next Up (for next iteration)
<!-- What the next iteration should focus on -->
- [ ] Start with first story from prd.json

## Blockers/Warnings
<!-- 
Things that didn't work — DON'T RETRY THESE
Document failures so future iterations avoid them
-->
- None yet
