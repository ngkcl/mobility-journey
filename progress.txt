## Codebase Patterns
- When adding new Expo Router routes, update `.expo/types/router.d.ts` so `router.push` stays type-safe.
- Keep Expo/React Native runtime-only modules (e.g. notifications) isolated from testable logic to avoid Node test loader issues.
- For streak calculations that check "active" status, use relative dates (today/yesterday) in tests.
- CSV export: escape commas/quotes properly, use native share sheet on mobile.
- For date logic that uses local time (`getHours`, `getDate`), write tests with local timestamps (no `Z`) to avoid timezone-dependent failures.

## 2025-02-09 - UX & Analytics Improvements

### Completed
1. **Fixed desktop TypeScript errors**
   - Added proper type declarations for @mediapipe/pose and @mediapipe/camera_utils
   - Added electron type reference for module resolution
   - Fixed posture-monitor.ts timer type (NodeJS.Timeout → ReturnType<typeof setInterval>)
   - Updated tsconfig.json with custom typeRoots

2. **Enhanced workout analytics** (lib/workoutAnalytics.ts)
   - `buildOverallAsymmetryTrend`: Track L/R volume imbalance across ALL exercises
   - `computeAsymmetrySummary`: Trend direction (improving/worsening/stable), dominant side
   - `buildWorkoutPainTrend`: Pain/energy levels before and after workouts
   - `computePainImpact`: Average pain change after workouts

3. **Added EmptyState component** (components/EmptyState.tsx)
   - Reusable empty state with icon, title, description, and action button
   - Consistent styling with design system

4. **Charts page enhancement** (app/(tabs)/charts.tsx)
   - Added "Balance Status" card showing current asymmetry %, dominant side, trend direction
   - Added "Pain Impact" card showing average pain change from workouts
   - Color-coded indicators for improvement/concern status

### Next Up
- [ ] Add EmptyState to more screens (exercises, workouts, metrics)
- [ ] Improve loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- [ ] Consider adding accessibility labels for screen readers
- [ ] Implement AirPods integration (needs dev build)

### Files Changed
- desktop/src/types/mediapipe.d.ts (new)

## 2026-02-08 - Desktop Posture App: Stats & Calibration Fixes

### Problem Diagnosed
Nick reported that after calibrating the posture monitor, stats stay at 0 and nothing happens.

**Root cause analysis:**
1. The app structure has TWO architectures:
   - Root-level JS files (main.js, preload.js, renderer.js) - ACTIVE, using MediaPipe via CDN
   - TypeScript in src/ - partially complete, src/main/ is EMPTY
   
2. Camera permission issues on macOS - the app wasn't properly requesting camera access.

3. Race condition in calibration - the calibration handler could be called multiple times if detectLoop continued running during calibration.

4. On systems without a camera (like Mac Mini), the app fails silently.

### Fixes Applied
1. **Camera permission handling** (main.js)
   - Added systemPreferences.askForMediaAccess('camera') on app ready
   - Shows notification if permission denied with instructions

2. **Better error messages** (renderer.js)
   - Camera errors now show specific messages (NotAllowedError, NotFoundError)
   - Added logging throughout for debugging

3. **Calibration race condition fix** (renderer.js)
   - Added `calibrationProcessed` flag to prevent double-processing
   - Skip detectLoop frames during calibration (isCalibrating check)
   - Restore normal handler BEFORE processing to prevent race

4. **Console logging from renderer** (main.js)
   - Added webContents.on('console-message') to forward renderer logs to main

5. **Stats API in preload** (preload.js)
   - Added getStats() and resetStats() to electronAPI for UI stats fetching

### Testing Notes
- Mac Mini has no camera, so app fails with "NotFoundError Requested device not found"
- On a device with camera (like Nick's laptop), the flow should work:
  1. App requests camera permission
  2. Camera initializes, MediaPipe loads
  3. Calibrate captures baseline
  4. detectLoop sends frames every 1.5s
  5. Stats accumulate in ~/.posture-data/stats.json

### Files Changed
- desktop/main.js (camera permission, logging)
- desktop/renderer.js (calibration fix, logging, error handling)
- desktop/preload.js (stats API)

### Next Steps
- [ ] Test on Nick's laptop with camera to verify full flow
- [ ] Consider adding a "mock camera" mode for development on devices without camera
- [ ] Add visual feedback when calibration countdown is happening

## [2026-02-09 05:14] - Story GL-001: Goal data model and storage

### Completed
- Added `lib/goals.ts` with goal domain types (`Goal`, `GoalType`, `GoalStatus`, `GoalProgress`) and progress-summary typing.
- Implemented goals data access helpers: `createGoal`, `updateGoal`, `deleteGoal`, `getGoals`, `getGoalProgress`.
- Implemented `computeGoalProgress(goal)` with direction-aware progress logic (pain goals decrease, score/consistency/streak goals increase), on-track calculation, projected completion, and trend detection.
- Added `lib/goals.test.js` with coverage for improvement goals, pain reduction, completion, regression, overdue goals, and projection behavior.
- Added Supabase migration `20260209_goals.sql` creating `goals` and `goal_progress` tables with constraints and indexes.
- Fixed pre-existing baseline test instability in `lib/homeSummary.test.js` (timezone-sensitive assertions and rotation expectation) so test suite is reliable.

### Next Up (for next iteration)
- [ ] Start GL-002: implement the goal creation wizard in `app/goals/new.tsx` with validation and smart defaults.
- [ ] Wire created goals into UI navigation flow and confirm create/save path against Supabase.

### Blockers/Warnings
- No blockers in this iteration.
- Existing workspace has unrelated modifications in `prd-workouts.json`; left untouched.

### Files Changed
- lib/goals.ts
- lib/goals.test.js
- supabase/migrations/20260209_goals.sql
- lib/homeSummary.test.js
- prd.json
- progress.txt

### Learnings (add to Codebase Patterns if reusable)
- Date tests for local-time logic should avoid `Z` timestamps to prevent timezone-dependent failures.

## [2026-02-11 01:04] - Story GL-002: Goal creation wizard

### Completed
- Created `app/goals/_layout.tsx` with Stack navigator + theme styling
- Created `app/goals/new.tsx` — full 4-step wizard (580 lines):
  - Step 1: Select from 6 goal types (pain reduction, symmetry, posture score, consistency, streak, custom) — each with icon, color, description, example
  - Step 2: Set starting/target values with +/- adjusters, direction-aware validation (lower-is-better for pain, higher-is-better for scores)
  - Step 3: Deadline picker with 4 presets (4/8/12/26 weeks), showing computed dates
  - Step 4: Review card with summary stats, projected pace per week, and milestone timeline (25/50/75/100%)
- Saves to Supabase via existing `createGoal()` from `lib/goals.ts`
- Full theme integration (colors, typography, radii from lib/theme)
- Step indicator with progress dots and connecting lines
- Bottom navigation bar with Back/Next/Create Goal actions
- Validation prevents impossible goals (target must be achievable relative to start)
- TypeScript clean — `npx tsc --noEmit` passes

### Next Up (for next iteration)
- [ ] Start GL-003: Goals dashboard and list view (app/(tabs)/goals.tsx)
- [ ] Add goals tab to main navigation in _layout.tsx
- [ ] Wire "Add Goal" button from goals list to /goals/new

### Blockers/Warnings
- None. Clean build.

## [2026-02-11 05:00] - Stories GL-003, GL-004, GL-005: Goals dashboard, detail screen, auto-tracking

### Completed
- GL-003: Goals dashboard (`app/(tabs)/goals.tsx`) — new tab with summary stats, goal cards, progress bars, FAB, empty state, collapsible past goals
- GL-004: Goal detail screen (`app/goals/[id].tsx`) — progress ring, stats, milestones, projection, history, actions (complete/pause/delete)
- GL-005: Automatic progress tracking (`lib/goalTracker.ts`) — metric→goal mapping, auto-update on metric save, workout consistency/streak recalc, batch refresh, auto-completion
- Tab layout updated: Goals replaces Plan in visible tabs, Plan moved to hidden tabs
- 12 new tests all passing, TypeScript clean

### Next Up (for next iteration)
- [ ] Start GL-006: Goal celebrations and notifications (confetti, milestone toasts, badges)
- [ ] Start GL-007: Goal suggestions based on data (AI-powered recommendations)
- [ ] Wire goalTracker into metric entry screens (call trackMetricUpdate when saving metrics)
- [ ] Wire goalTracker into workout completion flow (call trackWorkoutCompleted)

### Blockers/Warnings
- None. Clean build.

### Files Changed
- app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx (Goals tab added, Plan moved to hidden)
- app/(tabs)/goals.tsx (new - Goals dashboard)
- app/goals/[id].tsx (new - Goal detail screen)
- lib/goalTracker.ts (new - Automatic progress tracking)
- lib/goalTracker.test.js (new - 12 tests)

  - `CelebrationProvider` wraps app root, renders MilestoneToast + GoalCelebration overlay
  - `useCelebration()` hook: checkAndCelebrate, showMilestoneToast, showCelebration
  - Celebration queue: processes multiple milestones sequentially (toast → toast → full modal)
  - Auto-awards badges via `checkAndAwardBadges` on goal completion
- Updated `lib/goalTracker.ts`: New `TrackResult` return type with `previousValues` map
  - `trackMetricUpdate()` and `trackWorkoutCompleted()` now return previous values
  - Enables milestone detection (was 20% → now 26% = crossed 25% milestone)
- Updated `app/_layout.tsx`: Added CelebrationProvider to root layout
- Updated `app/(tabs)/metrics.tsx`: After saving a check-in, tracks pain/posture/symmetry goals and fires celebrations
