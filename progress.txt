## Codebase Patterns
- Parse date-only strings with `new Date(\`\${dateStr}T00:00:00\`)` to avoid timezone off-by-one in UI comparisons/formatting.

## 2026-02-07 01:31 - Story 1: Run quality checks and fix failures

### Completed
- Replaced `<img>` with `next/image` in photo timeline and video gallery to satisfy lint rules.
- Verified `bun run typecheck` and `bun run lint` pass.

### Next Up (for next iteration)
- [ ] Review streak calculation, daily compliance, and scheduling logic for timezone/off-by-one issues (Story 2).
- [ ] Review migrations for exercise_library/appointments tables and add missing indexes/constraints/RLS if needed (Story 3).

### Blockers/Warnings
- `bun test` reports no tests found; no automated test suite currently configured.

### Files Changed
- src/components/PhotoTimeline.tsx
- src/components/VideoGallery.tsx
- prd.json

### Learnings (add to Codebase Patterns if reusable)
- None

## 2026-02-07 02:10 - Story 2: Review exercise and streak logic

### Completed
- Normalized date-only parsing in appointment and todo scheduling to avoid timezone/off-by-one errors.
- Ensured exercise log dates use local date strings for consistency with streak logic.

### Next Up (for next iteration)
- [ ] Review migrations for exercise_library/appointments tables and add missing indexes/constraints/RLS if needed (Story 3).
- [ ] Verify any other date-only fields that should be normalized for local display.

### Blockers/Warnings
- `pnpm test` reports no tests specified; no automated test suite currently configured.

### Files Changed
- src/components/TodoTracker.tsx
- src/components/AppointmentTracker.tsx
- prd.json
- progress.txt

### Learnings (add to Codebase Patterns if reusable)
- Use a local date-only parser for `YYYY-MM-DD` strings before comparisons/formatting.
