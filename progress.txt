## Codebase Patterns
- Supabase client uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`.

## 2026-02-07 04:24 - Story 1: Set up Supabase client and database schema

### Completed
- Added Supabase client wrapper and env example for project configuration.
- Created initial SQL migration defining photos, metrics, analysis_logs, and todos tables with indexes.
- Fixed lint errors unrelated to the story to keep checks green.

### Next Up (for next iteration)
- [ ] Story 2: Persist photos to Supabase Storage and load from database on page load.
- [ ] Decide on storage bucket naming and public vs signed URL strategy.

### Blockers/Warnings
- `pnpm lint` reports `@next/next/no-img-element` warnings in `src/components/PhotoTimeline.tsx` (not errors).

### Files Changed
- src/lib/supabaseClient.ts
- supabase/migrations/20260207120000_init.sql
- .env.example
- src/components/MetricsTracker.tsx
- src/components/PhotoTimeline.tsx

### Learnings (add to Codebase Patterns if reusable)
- None beyond the pattern noted above.

## 2026-02-07 04:25 - Story 2: Persist photos to Supabase Storage

### Completed
- Loaded photos from Supabase `photos` table on mount and normalized URLs.
- Uploaded images to `progress-photos` storage bucket and saved metadata to Supabase.
- Added view selector for uploads and wired deletes to remove DB and storage records.

### Next Up (for next iteration)
- [ ] Story 3: Persist metrics to database and load historical data.
- [ ] Confirm Supabase storage bucket permissions (public vs signed) and update if needed.

### Blockers/Warnings
- `pnpm test` reports no tests specified (project has no tests yet).

### Files Changed
- src/components/PhotoTimeline.tsx
- prd.json
- progress.txt

### Learnings (add to Codebase Patterns if reusable)
- None.
