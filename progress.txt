# Ralph Loop Progress

## Codebase Patterns (READ THIS FIRST!)
<!-- 
Consolidated learnings from all iterations.
Add REUSABLE patterns here, not story-specific details.
-->
- 

---

## Current Goal
<!-- High-level objective from PRD -->


## Metrics
- **Iteration:** 0 of MAX
- **Stories Complete:** 0 of TOTAL
- **Tests:** X passing, Y failing
- **Coverage:** Z%

---

## Last Completed
<!-- Most recent iteration's work -->
- [ ] Nothing yet — first iteration

## Next Up (for next iteration)
<!-- What the next iteration should focus on -->
- [ ] Start with first story from prd.json

## Blockers/Warnings
<!-- 
Things that didn't work — DON'T RETRY THESE
Document failures so future iterations avoid them
-->
- None yet

## Session Log

<!-- 
Each iteration appends here using this format:

---
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Story [ID]: [Title]

### Completed
- What was implemented
- Key decisions made

### Next Up (for next iteration)
- [ ] Immediate next task
- [ ] Following task

### Blockers/Warnings
- Things that didn't work
- Edge cases discovered

### Files Changed
- path/to/file1.ts
- path/to/file2.ts

### Learnings (add to Codebase Patterns if reusable)
- Patterns discovered
- Gotchas encountered

## 2026-02-07 01:03 - Story 3: Streak tracking and gamification

### Completed
- Added streak summary (current, longest, total days) based on scheduled exercise completion
