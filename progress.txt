### Completed
- Ran bun typecheck and lint to validate the baseline
- Replaced raw img tags with next/image for dashboard, photo timeline, and video gallery thumbnails
- Re-ran lint and typecheck to confirm clean

### Next Up (for next iteration)
- [ ] Review dashboard components for correctness (trend logic, empty states, date edge cases)
- [ ] Review API endpoints and data flow (error handling, query efficiency, AI rate limiting)

### Blockers/Warnings
