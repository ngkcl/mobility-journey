## Codebase Patterns
- Use valid expo-router typed routes (e.g. /analysis) for Link hrefs to satisfy typecheck.

### Blockers/Warnings
- None.

### Files Changed

## 2026-02-07 12:29 - Story AP-001: Switch to development build with expo-dev-client

### Completed
- Installed expo-dev-client and updated lockfile.
- Set iOS bundle identifier and NSMotionUsageDescription in app.json.
- Ran `npx expo prebuild` successfully to generate native folders.
- Fixed expo-router typed Link target in not-found screen to pass typecheck.

### Next Up (for next iteration)
- [ ] Implement AP-002: add react-native-headphone-motion and create hook.
- [ ] Add motion permission handling and fallback UI behavior.

### Blockers/Warnings
- CocoaPods gem install failed; Homebrew install succeeded during prebuild.
- Native folders `ios/` and `android/` are gitignored; regenerate as needed.
- `git push` failed because no `origin` remote is configured.

### Files Changed
- app.json
- app/+not-found.tsx
- package.json
- pnpm-lock.yaml
- prd.json
- progress.txt

### Learnings (add to Codebase Patterns if reusable)
- Expo prebuild will try gem install for CocoaPods first, then fall back to Homebrew.
