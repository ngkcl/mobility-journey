# Ralph Loop Progress

## Codebase Patterns (READ THIS FIRST!)
<!-- 
Consolidated learnings from all iterations.
Add REUSABLE patterns here, not story-specific details.
-->
- Add `src/vitest.d.ts` with `vitest/globals` references to satisfy `tsc --noEmit` on test files.

---

## Current Goal
<!-- High-level objective from PRD -->


## Metrics
- **Iteration:** 0 of MAX
- **Stories Complete:** 0 of TOTAL
- **Tests:** X passing, Y failing
- **Coverage:** Z%

---

## Last Completed
<!-- Most recent iteration's work -->
- [ ] Nothing yet — first iteration

## Next Up (for next iteration)
<!-- What the next iteration should focus on -->
- [ ] Start with first story from prd.json

## Blockers/Warnings
<!-- 
Things that didn't work — DON'T RETRY THESE
Document failures so future iterations avoid them
-->
- None yet

---

## Session Log

<!-- 
Each iteration appends here using this format:

---
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Story [ID]: [Title]

### Completed
- What was implemented
- Key decisions made

### Next Up (for next iteration)
- [ ] Immediate next task
- [ ] Following task

### Blockers/Warnings
- Things that didn't work
- Edge cases discovered

### Files Changed
- path/to/file1.ts
- path/to/file2.ts

### Learnings (add to Codebase Patterns if reusable)
- Patterns discovered
- Gotchas encountered

## 2026-02-07 00:06 - Story 1: Set up testing infrastructure

### Completed
- Added Vitest + Testing Library config and setup, including `vitest.config.ts` and `vitest.setup.ts`
- Added a passing component test for `LoadingState`
- Updated `package.json` test script and devDependencies for the test stack

### Next Up (for next iteration)
- [ ] Story 5: replace `<img>` with `next/image` to clear lint warnings
- [ ] Story 2: add unit tests for Supabase data layer

### Blockers/Warnings
- Lint currently reports `@next/next/no-img-element` warnings in `PhotoTimeline` and `VideoGallery`

### Files Changed
- package.json
- vitest.config.ts
- vitest.setup.ts
- src/components/__tests__/LoadingState.test.tsx
- src/vitest.d.ts
- prd.json

### Learnings (add to Codebase Patterns if reusable)
- `tsc --noEmit` requires Vitest globals to be referenced via a `.d.ts` include
